The pump would be told to start pumping until the max pressure: 129mmHg. 
The participant would be instructed to press space bar when it began to feel painful. Then, the cuff would deflate immediately and script would save the pressure value as threshold.
This would be repeated 3 times. (Pump until it is painful and save the threshold)
The average of 3 collected threshold values would then be increased by 10% to form the final “pain” threshold.
The script would also calculate the so called “pressure” threshold: the average of 3 collected threshold values decreased by 10%

Example:
Threshold 1:    44
Threshold 2:    49
Threshold 3:    27
Avg = 40
Pain Threshold:    44 (avg+avg*0.1)
Pressure Threshold:    20 (avg-avg*0.5)

Values in mmHg are calculated by multiplying the raw value by 1.01372549 
I.e: 44*1.01372549=44.60 mmHg
